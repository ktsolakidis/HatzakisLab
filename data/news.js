    title: "We are awarded!",
    text: "We are delighted to be awarded the prestigious 60m DKK challenge grant by the Novo Nordisk Foundation for creating a “Center for Optimized Oligo Escape and Control of Disease’. This center will form a bridge between my lab at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen with the co-PIs Tom Kirchhausen at Harvard Medical School, Knud J. Jensen at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen and Maria Carmo-Fonseca at University of Lisbon. While Oligonucleotide therapeutics are emerging as important therapeutics for pathologies such as immune, cancer, muscular and neurological diseases as well as for control of viral pathogens, their use is limited by their poor intercellular delivery: less than 5% escape endosomes. The scope of the Centre is to provide the required mechanistic understanding to optimize subcellular delivery of RNA and other oligonucleotides entrapped in endosomes, develop methods for their efficient cellular delivery, and demonstrate applicability by targeting skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. The center will use sophisticated microscopes to measure oligonucleotide-membrane interaction in vitro and in live cells, AI tools to analyse the data and design and synthesize better DNA and RNA pharmaceutics that escape endosomes.

    text: "Nikos Hatzakis is beginning a new chapter in his academic career as a visiting professor in Harvard medical school. He will be in the department of Pediatrics in the program of cellular and Molecular Biomedicine associated the Harvard cell biology and Boston Children hospital. His work has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein biomolecular recognition and how this is translated to cellular responses, by combining states of the single molecule microscopy and quantitative, often machine learning driven, image analysis. At Harvard, he will continue to explore these fascinating areas of biology, in tight collaboration with Tom Kirchhausen and colleagues across disciplines to advance our understanding of cellular processes.",
